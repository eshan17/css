This was part of the third assignment in a brand new class called Cross-Platform Mobile Web Apps (15-237) at Carnegie Mellon.
We had to design and implement the site found here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-aHg_5UupI . This was written in HTML and CSS3.

You can download the source code and click on index.html to run it.
